## **Overview**

Blockset, a blockchain data integration platform, enables engineering teams to build enterprise-grade blockchain applications. To enhance its adoption, the project required a robust documentation platform and a marketing website that could bridge the gap between technical nuance and user onboarding needs.

As Lead Product Designer, I collaborated with BRD’s internal design team, external stakeholders, and my team to create a unified documentation site and marketing page. These efforts helped improve developer confidence, streamline integration processes, and elevate Blockset’s market presence.

## **The Journey**

### Challenges

- Developers needed a clearer, more accessible documentation platform to simplify their onboarding experience.
- The marketing website had to present Blockset’s technical capabilities in a way that resonated with enterprise clients.

I led the design and execution of this initiative on the Decent side, focusing on delivering developer-centric tools while enhancing the platform’s business appeal. This required synthesizing input across multiple teams, iterating based on user feedback, and ensuring the final product balanced technical depth with usability.

### **Design Outcomes**

- **Streamlined Information Architecture**: Restructured existing documentation to improve accessibility and logical flow for developers.
- **Synthesized Stakeholder Input**: Integrated feedback from BRD’s internal teams and external stakeholders to refine the platform’s UX.
- **Developed Interactive Marketing Features**: Designed engaging tools, such as a pricing slider and feature prototypes, to showcase Blockset’s offerings.
- **Designed Developer Sandbox**: Worked closely with engineers on both teams to design and refine a hands-on environment for testing API requests.

### **Customer Outcomes**
